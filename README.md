User-Friendly Frontend:
Our frontend is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces. You can easily input your desired location, whether it's a city name or geographic coordinates.
Robust Backend with Spring Boot: At the backend, we have employed Spring Boot, a powerful framework that simplifies Java application development. The Spring Boot controller handles incoming requests from the frontend and processes them accordingly.
OpenWeather API Integration:
To provide you with accurate weather information, we communicate with the OpenWeather API. We use the okhttp3 package to make HTTP requests to the API, passing your location as a query parameter.
Neatly Displayed Weather Data:
After receiving the weather data from the OpenWeather API, our backend processes the JSON response and extracts the relevant details, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Real-Time Weather Updates:
The neatly organized weather information is then sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed to you in real-time. You can see all the essential weather details at a glance.
